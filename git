Branch
A branch is a pointer to a partcilar commit.
The default branch that git creates for you when a new repository is initialised is called master.
We can use git branch command to list, createc delete andanipulate branches.
Merging
The term that Git uses for combining branched data and hitory together.
We use git checkout to check out the latest snapshot for both the files and for branches.
Git uses two different algorithms to perform a merge: fast-forward and three-way merge

Merging
The term git uses for combining branched data and history together.
Git uses two  different algorithms to performa merge: fast-forward and three way merge.

Branch:A pointer to  a particular commit,  representing an independent line of development in a  project.
Commit ID: An identifier next to the word  commit in the log
Fast-Forward merge:A merge when all the commits in the checked out branch are also in  the branch that's  being merged
Head: This points  to  the top of the branch that is being used
Master: The default branch that Git creates for  when a new repository initialized, commonly used to placed approved pieces of a project
Merge Conflict: This occurs when the changes are made on the same part of the same  file, and Git won't know how to merge those changes.
Rollback: The act of reverting changes made to a software to a  previous state
Three-way merge: A merge when the  snapshots at the two branch tips with the most recent common ancestor, the  commit befoe  the divergence.

What is secure shell?

Secure shell is a robust protocol for connecting to servers remotely.In the realm  of remote server access, security is going to be more and more
important to  keep your information safe. Secure shell  is primarily used for logging in to Linux  Servers, Unix Servers and certain networking
equipment such routers.

ALternatives to SSH

SSH provides a shield against prying eyes, but how does it compare to alternatives?
Telnet is one popular alternative. Telnet exposes your type commands  including passwords, to anyone on the network  with right tools/
Although Transport Layer Security (TLS) encrypts data within browsers, SSH secures data in interactive terminal sessions or file transfers.
This encryption ensures that sensitive information remains confidential during communications.

Another alternative is virtual private networks (VPNs). VPNs also offer encryption but grant access to entire networks after connection. SSH adheres
to entire networks after connection. SSH adheres to the principle of least privilege, restricting users to specific hosts, enhancing security.
Another option might be remote-control software like VNC or GoToMyPC. They focus on graphical user interface and desktop experiences, which
may not align with most Linux servers that operate sans desktop environments.

Operation

SSH operates through two key componenets: the SSH server and the SSH client. The SSH server, residing on the target device, establishes secure network 
connections, undergoes mutual authentication, and intiates encrypted login sessions or file transfers.

Conversely, the SSH client establishes a connection to the SSH server, ensuring a secure interaction. The client makes requests, such as "log me in" or 
"copy this file."

SSH keys

In the SSH protocol, an access credential is known as an SSH key. It serves a similar purpose as usernames and passwords, although system administrators
and power users typically use the keys to automate procedures and achieve single sign-on.

Displaying the fingerprint of an SSH key is a useful way to verify that you're using the correct and that the remote server's key  hasn't been tampered
with. To display the finger print of an SSH key, you can use the SSH-keygen command-line tool.

Key takeaways


SSH prioritizes security in remote server access: Secure shell (SSH) is a robust and trusted protocol for securely connecting to servers remotely. It
finds widespread use in accessing Linux servers, Unix servers and specific networking equipmen, serving as a sheild against unauthorized access 
and breaches.

Comparing SSH with alternatives: When you compare SSH to alternatives like Telnet, its security superiority becomes  clear.
Telent exposes commands including passwords, to  potential  threats , whereas SSH's encryption guarantees confidentiality during interactions with the 
server and enables secure login or file copying.

Just like a password, the security of your SSH key is critical. Never share yout SSH private key with anyone or put SSH keys into your application code.
WIth someone having access to your information, they can gain unauthorized access by logging in and pretending to be you.
